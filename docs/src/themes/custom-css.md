### Custom CSS file

We have made [an empty CSS file with all thr relavant selectors](https://github.com/greenpress/greenpress/blob/main/docs/src/themes/custom-styles-base.css).
you can use it in order to design your website.

Example CSS Files:

1.  [Base file with selectors only](https://github.com/greenpress/greenpress/blob/main/docs/src/themes/custom-styles-base.css)
2.  [Classic design (WIP)](https://github.com/greenpress/greenpress/blob/main/docs/src/themes/custom-styles-classic.css)
